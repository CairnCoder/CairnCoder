## Welcome

I learned to code through the UK BBC Microbit endeavour back in 2017 (ish). Since then I have learned alot and done various personal projects, only a few of which are listed here. They are at different stages of completion and size. Some have effective commentory while others are sparse. There is a tendency for UI development, but only because those projects can be used in daily life.

Please remember:
- I don't have a Computer Science degree, but did take some Physics/Maths programming modules at university.
- I do have a life outside of coding and can thus only code in my spare time.
- I have an understanding of coding structures upto class inheritance, pointers, etc, and an idea of basic algorithums.
- I will continue to add personal projects.
- Academic projects are not listed here.

I intend to make my own website page at some point but in the meantime here are a few other of my achivements.
