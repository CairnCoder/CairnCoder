## Welcome

I learned to code through the UK BBC Microbit endeavour back in 2017 (ish). Since then I have learned alot and done various projects, only a few of which are listed here. They are at different stages of completion and size. Some have effective commentary while others, such as those under active development, are sparse.
Please remember, I have a life outside of coding and can only code in my spare time.
