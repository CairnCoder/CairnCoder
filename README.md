## Welcome

I learned to code through the UK BBC Microbit endeavour back in 2017 (ish). Since then I have learned alot and done various personal projects, only a few of which are listed here. They are at different stages of completion and size. Some have effective commentary while others, such as those under active development, are sparse.

Please remember:
- I don't have a Computer Science degree, but did take programming for Physics/Maths modules at uni.
- I do have a life outside of coding and can only do it in my spare time.
- I have an understanding of coding structures upto class inheritance, pointers, etc.
- I will continue to add personal projects.
- Academic projects are not listed here.
